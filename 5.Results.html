        <h3> 5.1. Stiffness Fabrication and Characterization </h3>
        <p>
          As a preliminary study, the team had previously developed five MeHA 
          formula with a wide range of stiffness levels, and tested the 
          crosslinking time of the MeHA (Appendix A).

        <h4> 5.1.1. Tissue Stiffness Test</h4>
        <p>
          To better replicate the stiffness of various tumor tissues, we first 
          characterized the stiffness distribution of various tissue types by 
          measuring Young’s modulus with atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown 
          in Figure 12a, the tissue stiffness varied significantly across 
          different groups, with mean Young’s modulus values ranging from 
          1.1 kPa (LM#2) to 6.8 kPa (OC#4). Most samples exhibited stiffness 
          values between 0.1 to 3 kPa, whereas stiffer tissues 
          (e.g., CRC#6, OC#6) displayed Young’s modulus values extending 
          beyond 4 kPa. These variations highlight the heterogeneity 
          in tumor microenvironments. Therefore, there is a need for 
          biomaterials that can mimic a broad range of mechanical properties.

      <div id="5.1.2.Development">
        <h4> 5.1.2. Development of Tunable Stiffness</h4>
        <p>
          To recapitulate these diverse mechanical environments, we further expanded 
          the stiffness range by varying the LAP concentrations, in addition to 
          the concentrations of MeHA. The Young's modulus of the resulting 
          hydrogels is proportional to the LAP concentration, ranging from 
          0.29 kPa (MeHA-1, 1% LAP) to 7.14 kPa (MeHA-5, 1% LAP), covering 
          a wide spectrum of stiffness level (Figure 12b). This tunability 
          is essential for creating ex vivo models that better represent 
          PDTE under physiologically relevant conditions.

      <div id="5.1.3.Impact">
        <h4> 5.1.3. Impact of Hydrogel Stiffness on Cell Viability </h4>
        <p>
          The effect of hydrogel stiffness on cell viability was 
          assessed by measuring normalized cell viability over a 12-day 
          culture period (Figure 12c). HA-5 promoted the highest cell 
          viability over time. Therefore, this formula was used for 
          further studies of the other parameters. It was observed that 
          high stiffness hydrogels (HA-7 to HA10) exhibited a decline in 
          viability. These findings align with previous studies demonstrating 
          that excessive matrix stiffness can impair cell proliferation and 
          viability, likely due to increased cellular stress and reduced 
          nutrient diffusion. Therefore, to improve nutrient diffusion, 
          particularly for long-term culture systems, GMP plates were 
          included to enhance porosity for cell growth.

        <h4>5.2. GMP Fabrication and Pore Characterization</h4>
        <p>
          To create pores for cell migration and nutrient diffusion, GMP of different sizes 
          were added to MeHA (Section 3.2.2.1). We hypothesized that smaller pores may confine 
          cell movement, while the larger pores would allow multicellular aggregates and stromal 
          interactions. Initially, clumps formed after filtration and even vortexing (Figure 13b) 
          due to excessive filtration, removing stabilizing oil. A scissor-cutting step was done 
          for particle dispersion but led to irregular GMP (Figure 13c) and poorly interconnected 
          pores with poor shapes after GMP dissolution (Figure 13d). This is undesirable since 
          pore interconnectivity and shape affect cell proliferation, while irregular or 
          collapsed pores can limit diffusion, causing necrosis [38][39] . 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="5.2.1.Optimization">
        <h4> 5.2.1. Optimization of GMP and Pore Fabrication </h4>
        <p>
          To reduce aggregation, we moderated oil filtration, collecting 
          GMP while still moist. The residual oil was removed by washing 
          with excess acetone and vortex until the particles became white 
          and the supernatant was clear. This reduced clump formation, 
          avoiding the scissor cutting step. SEM analysis (Figure 13e) 
          further confirmed that most GMP were individually dispersed 
          and had a circular shape, with fewer aggregates even among 
          the larger particles, resulting in more interconnected and 
          circular pores (Figure 13g). They were analyzed with Image 
          J and presented in Figure 13h and 13i. Every group was named 
          after the average size calculated. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Three larger GMP size and the resultant pore sizes were 
          successfully fabricated. Since tumor cells range from 10 to 
          20 µm, we fabricated a smaller GMP to create diverse pore 
          sizes for studying cell behavior [40]. We attempted to 
          lower the mass and increased the stirring speed using the 
          GMP protocol as described in Section 4.2.2.1. The average 
          particle size obtained was around 100 µm. As such, we 
          explored a double emulsion (O/W/O) method. After trying 
          0.5 g, 1 g and 2 g gelatin with 1000 rpm stirring speed, 
          we observed the following (Figure 13k). 
        </p>

        <p>
          At 0.5 g, 1000 rpm, the resulting particles were smaller 
          than 50 µm but highly irregular in shape. Increasing the 
          gelatin mass to 1 g, stirring at 1000 rpm, a well-defined, 
          spherical morphology with a mean size of approximately 50 µm, 
          suggesting an optimal balance between shear force and 
          interfacial tension during emulsification. Interestingly, 
          when we used the same condition but a 1000ml beaker 
          (2000ml beaker for the rest) with the same volume of 
          ethanol, a higher yield of particles was obtained but 
          with excessive fragmentation, likely due to intensified 
          shear stress in the smaller beaker. Further increasing the 
          gelatin mass to 2 g, stirring at 1000 rpm led to 
          significantly larger particles (100 µm) with some 
          coalescence, likely due to the increased viscosity 
          reducing droplet breakup efficiency. Based on these 
          findings, the 1 g, 1000 rpm condition was selected 
          for the smallest pore formation. Following the trend (Figure 13j), 
          even though the average actual particle size was 60 µm, the 
          resultant pore size was 30 µm, smaller than the particle size. 
          This pore size could provide sufficient space for individual 
          cells to migrate. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To improve efficiency, we fabricated a new mold for GMP plate production. 
          Initially, the GMP plates were fabricated in a rectangular PDMS mold 
          with 2 mm height, and the GMP plates were obtained using a punch 
          biopsy of a 6 mm radius (Figure 13l). However, precise annealing was 
          needed to prevent sticking or fracturing (Figure 13m). To simplify 
          this, a PDMS mold with 6 mm wells (Figure 10) was used, allowing direct 
          GMP formation. This eliminated punching, extended annealing time and 
          ensured consistent, easily demolded plates without strict timing control. 
          To conclude, four sizes of particles and resultant spatially defined porosity and crosslinking were fabricated.
          A size difference between the particles and pores formed was observed, with an escalation correlating with the increase in particle and pore sizes.

        <h4> 5.3. Stiffness Characterization of Porous MeHA</h4>
        <p>
          With the optimized porous MeHA protocol, stiffness 
          characterization was conducted again with the inclusion of 
          140 µm GMP plates and 2mg/ml of RGD for all conditions. A 
          new range of stiffness was established. It could be observed 
          that compared to MeHA without GMP plates (Figure 12), the Young's modulus 
          tested was slightly lower since pores were formed, resisting the 
          gel’s ability to resist deformation. The first condition will 
          continue to be used for further material studies.

      <div id="5.4.Dissolution">
        <h4> 5.4. GMP Dissolution Test</h4>
        <p>
          To determine the GMP plates dissolution rate, a dissolution 
          test was conducted as described in Section 4.2.5.. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All porous MeHA exhibited a progressive increase in dissolution, 
          reaching near-complete dissolution (~100%) by 5th hour. 
          MeHA_60 showed the slowest dissolution rate, followed by 
          MeHA_140 and MeHA_290, indicating that small GMP with 
          small gaps in between particles, were harder to penetrate, 
          which may affect initial nutrient diffusion into the 
          gel during culture. This results suggest that finding an 
          optimal GMP, hence pore size for culture is crucial for 
          balancing between controlling cell migration and nutrient 
          diffusion. Additionally, fluctuations in dissolution 
          percentages over time could be attributed to 
          aggregation effects or slight mass difference in 
          the GMP plates used. The error bars indicate 
          variability across replicates, suggesting that 
          while the trends are consistent, further 
          optimization of dissolution conditions may enhance reproducibility.

          2mg/ml RGD and MeHA_140 were used to culture melanoma and 
          ovarian cancer tumor explants. Medium was changed every 
          two days from day 0. Surface area images were taken on days 
          0, 3, 7, and 12 for ImageJ analysis. Confocal microscopy on days 
          3, 7, and 12 assessed viabilities. Figure 16a and 16b show the 
          initial sample conditions.

        <h4> 5.5.1. Cell Viability </h4>

        <p>
          Melanoma cell viability increased over time, with a significant difference between 
          MeHA and PTFE at Day 12 (p < 0.05), suggesting MeHA 
          supports sustained growth. In contrast, ovarian cancer cells 
          showed consistently low viability in both conditions, potentially due 
          to samples not properly submerged into after extraction. A buffer maintains 
          the physiological conditions of the tissue during transportation, essential 
          for cellular viability and function. Confocal images further supported these 
          findings, showing higher melanoma cell density in MeHA, while ovarian cancer 
          cells, exhibited limited spreading and clustering, reinforcing reduced 
          viability observations at later time points (D7, D12).

        <h4> 5.5.2. Surface Area Change </h4>
        <p>
          For melanoma, explants maintained a stable surface area over 12 days, 
          with no significant changes across time points or between materials, 
          suggesting MeHA supports morphological preservation similarly to PTFE. 
          Ovarian cancer samples expanded over time, particularly in MeHA, likely 
          due to rehydration after inadequate buffer submersion post-resection. 
          MeHA’s high water retention and the structural loosening due to ECM 
          remodeling support might have contributed to this expansion. In contrast, 
          PTFE, which is a more inert material with limited hydration potential, 
          did not induce the same degree of swelling. These findings highlight the 
          importance of standardized tissue handling in hydrogel-based models to 
          ensure consistent and reliable measurements of tumor behavior.
