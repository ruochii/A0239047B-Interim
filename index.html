        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases, 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, 
          approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease [1]. 
          Chemotherapies and radiotherapies are the standard of care for cancer treatment; 
          however, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach often results in treatment 
          noncompliance among patients. Many individuals also experience 
          severe side effects during or after treatment, including hair loss, skin damage, 
          fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues [2]. This clinical landscape underscores the urgent need for novel 
          strategies to improve patient stratification, minimize side reactions and systemic toxicity, and enhance 
          patients’ overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precision oncology is an emerging approach to cancer treatment that seeks to address 
          this unmet clinical need by tailoring treatments based on patients’ profiles. 
          A key component of precision oncology involves significant research efforts to develop 
          novel therapies with cancer-targeting capability. Notable examples include 
          targeted therapies (HER-2, EGFR, VEGF inhibitors) and immunotherapies (PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4), 
          with many of them showing promising results in both in vitro and in vivo studies [3][4]. 
          However, translating these novel drug classes into clinical practice has been slow. This delay can  
          largely be attributed to the limitations of inappropriate preclinical models 
          used for drug screening and validation. Models like in vitro cell lines and xenografted 
          mice, although useful for exploring tumor biology in controlled environments, often lack the 
          predictive power needed to determine the most effective treatment strategies for individual patients [5]. Consequently, more than 90% of the biologics 
          shortlisted from these models fail to provide clinical benefits in trials [5].
        </p>
        <p>
          Advancements in our understanding of tumor biology have emphasized the critical role of 
          tumor heterogeneity, especially within the tumor microenvironment (TME), in influencing 
          tumor responses to therapies [6]. Unfortunately, traditional reductionist models such as 
          cell lines and mouse models fail to accurately replicate the native TME. Therefore, 
          there is a pressing demand for cancer models that can effectively recapitulate the TME, 
          thereby improving drug assessment and facilitating the clinical translation of advanced 
          oncological strategies.
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/tme.jpg" 
          subtitle="<b>Figure 1: Components in TME and their functions [6].</b>"></image-component>
        <p>
          Patient-derived tumor explants (PDTE) emerge as a superior option for studying drug 
          responses and developing new cancer treatments for their ability to preserve key elements 
          of the native TME. Recent studies have demonstrated that PDTE maintains cell viability, 
          stromal composition, tissue architectural integrity, and cell-cell interactions [7]. Several 
          investigations among them further established the strong clinical correlations between 
          PDTE-derived drug responses and patient outcomes, showcasing the remarkable potential 
          of these ex vivo models in bridging preclinical findings to patient care [8][9][10].
        </p>
        <p>
          However, current ex vivo models still face limitations, notably their short lifespan 
          and the rapid degradation of structural and genetic features typically within 2 to 3 days [5]. 
          This short duration poses challenges for applications like cyclic drug testing, which 
          require longer timeframes for assessment—often on the order of weeks [11]. Additionally, for 
          treatments such as immunotherapies, which aim to reinvigorate immune cells’ cancer-killing 
          activity without direct cytotoxicity like chemotherapy, the time needed for therapeutic 
          effects is extended, likely exceeding the 3-day window [12]. Hence, extending the viability of 
          PDTE ex vivo is crucial for expanding its clinical applicability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our recent study (currently under peer review), we demonstrated that embedding peritoneal 
          metastases (PM) PDTE in hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels significantly extended survival to at 
          least 8 days, outperforming traditional methods such as PTFE inserts and Matrigel [5]. 
          Notably, our findings underscored the critical role of hydrogel stiffness as a determinant 
          of PM PDTE cultivation outcomes. This observation aligns with prior studies highlighting 
          the stiffness-dependent growth behavior of cancer cells, reinforcing the broader relevance 
          of mechanical cues in tumor biology [13][14]. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on these insights, we hypothesize  that the heterogeneous stiffness profiles observed 
          across tumours (breast cancer tissue: over 4 kPa, lung cancer tissue: 20 to 30 kPa etc.)  
          necessitate tailored hydrogel properties for the optimized ex vivo maintenance of PDTE [15][16]. To test 
          this hypothesis, we aim to design and engineer HA hydrogels with precisely tunable physicochemical 
          properties, such as stiffness, and investigate whether distinct hydrogel formulations are required to 
          optimally support the growth and functional integrity of heterogenous tumour tissues.  
        </p> 
      </div>
        <p>
          For this proof-of-principle study, we selected HA hydrogels for their excellent biocompatibility, 
          biodegradability, and performance in our prior work. To achieve tunability, we will employ a multi-faceted 
          approach: 
          <br></br>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Chemical Modification: </b>Grafting methacrylate (Me) groups onto HA sidechains to enable 
              crosslinking and stiffness modulation.</li>
            <li><b>Templating Technology: </b>Utilizing our in-house-developed templating method to control 
              hydrogel architecture and mechanical properties with high precision.</li>
            <li><b>Functionalization: </b>Incorporating cell-adhesive peptides (e.g., RGD sequences) into the 
              hydrogel formulation to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) and enhance cell-matrix interactions.</li> 
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This integrated strategy will allow us to systematically investigate the impact of hydrogel stiffness 
          and other physicochemical properties (e.g., porosity, cell adhesiveness) on PDTE viability and functionality, providing a robust platform for future studies on tumour heterogeneity and personalized ex vivo models.
