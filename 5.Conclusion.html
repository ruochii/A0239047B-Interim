        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases, 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, 
          approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease [1]. 
          Chemotherapies and radiotherapies are the standard of care (SOC) for cancer treatment; 
          however, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach often results in treatment 
          noncompliance among a significant subgroup of patients. Many individuals also experience 
          severe side effects during or after treatment, including hair loss, skin damage, 
          fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues [2]. This clinical landscape underscores the urgent need for novel 
          strategies that can improve patient stratification, minimize side reactions and systemic toxicity, and enhance 
          patients’ overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precision oncology is an emerging approach to cancer treatment that seeks to address 
          this unmet clinical need by tailoring treatments based on patients’ individual profiles. 
          A key component of precision oncology involves significant research efforts aimed at 
          developing novel therapies with cancer-targeting capability. Notable examples include 
          targeted therapies (HER-2, EGFR, VEGF inhibitors) and immunotherapies (PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4), 
          with many of them showing promising results in both in vitro and in vivo studies [3][4]. 
          However, the translation of these novel drug classes into clinical practice has been slow. 
          This delay can largely be attributed to the limitations of inappropriate preclinical models 
          used for drug screening and validation. Models like in vitro cell lines and xenografted 
          mice, although useful for exploring tumor biology in controlled environments, often lack the 
          predictive power needed to determine the most effective treatment strategies for individual patients [5]. Consequently, more than 90% of the biologics 
          shortlisted from these models fail to provide clinical benefits in trials [5].
        </p>
        <p>
          Advancements in our understanding of tumor biology have emphasized the critical role of 
          tumor heterogeneity—especially within the tumor microenvironment (TME)—in influencing 
          tumor responses to therapies [6]. Unfortunately, traditional reductionist models such as 
          cell lines and mouse models fail to accurately replicate the native TME. Therefore, 
          there is a pressing demand for cancer models that can effectively recapitulate the TME, 
          thereby improving drug assessment and facilitating the clinical translation of advanced 
          oncological strategies.
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/tme.png"
          subtitle="Figure 1: Components in TME and their functions [6]. "></image-component>
        <p>
          Patient-derived tumor explants (PDTE) emerge as superior materials for studying drug 
          responses and developing new cancer treatments for their ability to preserve key elements 
          of the native TME. Recent studies have demonstrated that PDTE maintains cell viability, 
          stromal composition, tissue architectural integrity, and cell-cell interactions [7]. Several 
          investigations among them further established the strong clinical correlations between 
          PDTE-derived drug responses and patient outcomes, showcasing the remarkable potential 
          of these ex vivo models in bridging preclinical findings to patient care [8][9][10].
        </p>
        <p>
          However, current ex vivo models still face limitations, notably their short lifespan 
          and the rapid degradation of structural and genetic features typically within 2 to 3 days [5]. 
          This short duration poses challenges for applications like cyclic drug testing, which 
          require longer timeframes for assessment—often on the order of weeks [11]. Additionally, for 
          treatments such as immunotherapies, which aim to reinvigorate immune cells’ cancer-killing 
          activity without direct cytotoxicity like chemotherapy, the time needed for therapeutic 
          effects is extended, likely exceeding the 3-day window [12]. Hence, extending the viability of 
          PDTE ex vivo is crucial for expanding its clinical applicability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous research conducted in our lab (currently under peer review), 
          we demonstrated that embedding peritoneal metastases (PM) PDTE in hyaluronic acid (HA) 
          hydrogels significantly extended survival to at least 8 days, outperforming traditional 
          methods such as PTFE inserts and Matrigel[5]. We also identified that hydrogel properties, 
          such as stiffness, are critical determinants of PM PDTE cultivation outcomes. This inspires 
          us to design and engineer a hydrogel with precisely tunable physicochemical properties, 
          which allows us to systemically dissect different characteristics and their roles in PDTE 
          preservation ex vivo. In doing so, we aim to enhance PDTE viability and survival to the 
          extent which would enable the developed ex vivo system to support clinical applications 
          otherwise unattainable with existing methods. Given the natural variability in tumors 
          across different histologies, we aspire to create a hydrogel-based ex vivo platform that 
          accommodates a wide range of cancers. For this proof-of-principle study, we selected HA 
          hydrogels due to their excellent performance in our prior investigations. We plan to achieve 
          tunability in these hydrogels by modifying HA molecules through the grafting of methacrylate (Me) 
          to their sidechains, employing an in-house-developed templating technology, and incorporating 
          degradable crosslinkers into the hydrogel formulation.
