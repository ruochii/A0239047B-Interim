        <h3>2.1. Current PDTE Models</h3>
        <p>
          Tumor models must maintain tissue structure and stromal cell distribution for 
          effective evaluation of stromal-targeting therapies [5]. PDTE preserves native 
          architecture, cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, and immune composition, making them 
          essential for rapid drug testing in ex vivo studies [12].
        </p>
        <p>
          Several culturing methods have been explored to enhance the viability of tumor explants. 
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.1. Gelatin Sponge-based Cultures</h4>
        
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/gelatinsponge.png"
          subtitle="Figure 2: Gelatin sponge-based culture [5]. "></image-component>
        <p>
          PDE models using gelatin sponges are promising in preclinical drug testing and 
          studying tumor-microenvironment interactions. Yet, these models often experience 
          rapid tissue degradation and reduced viability within six days. This challenge was 
          partially addressed by advanced slicing technologies like vibratomes and 
          compresstomes, which ensure uniform sample thickness [5].
        </p>

      <div id="2.1.2.Matrigel">

        <p>
          Matrigel, an extract of a mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor, has facilitated the 
          structural and functional characterization of its components by providing large amounts of 
          ECM. It has been used for a variety of studies with embryonic, normal, and stem or malignant 
          cells [16]. However, it only supports a short-term culture of 3 days, and the viability of PDE 
          rapidly decreased afterwards [17].

      <div id="2.1.3.HA">

        <p>
          The Patient-derived hydrogel-assisted eXplants (PhaseX) hydrogel from the Translational Tumor 
          Engineering (TTE) lab provides enhanced support for PDE compared to traditional 
          PTFE membranes and Matrigel, using bioengineered hyaluronan (HA)-based hydrogels. HA’s 
          similarity to extracellular matrix (ECM) makes it a promising scaffold for tissue culture 
          [18]. PhaseX’s modifiable properties, such as stiffness, degradability, and adhesivity, 
          preserve tissue integrity, cellular diversity, and the viability of cancer-associated 
          fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells. However, adjustments for PDE from metastatic tumors 
          may require lower matrix adhesivity to prevent excessive cell invasion, and highly 
          vascularized tumors demand increased porosity for better nutrient and oxygen diffusion. 
          Although effective, PhaseX’s HA hydrogel system cannot independently modulate HA 
          concentration and stiffness, limiting its flexibility for varied applications.

        <h3>2.2. Effects of Matrix Properties on PDTE</h3>
        <p>
          To establish an effective hydrogel-based model, it is crucial to understand 
          how specific matrix properties interact with PDTE and influence their structural and 
          functional stability. Key biophysical factors include architecture (e.g., 
          dimensionality, topography, porosity) and mechanics (e.g., stiffness, elasticity), which 
          have been shown to influence cancer cell behavior, particularly in proliferation and 
          migration [13]. In this review, we examine the role of matrix properties in PDTE 
          preservation, focusing on how these factors influence the maintenance of tumor-like 
          behavior ex vivo. By integrating insights from recent studies, this review will provide 
          a foundation for designing an optimized hydrogel capable of extending PDTE viability for 
          precision oncology applications.

      <div id="2.2.1.Stiffness">
        <h4>2.2.1. Stiffness</h4>
        <p>
          Matrix stiffness, the extracellular environment’s rigidity, affects cell behavior, 
          stability and scaffold integrity [14 ]. Generally, stiffer matrices promote greater cell 
          spreading, proliferation, and differentiation, as cells detect and respond to mechanical 
          signals in their surroundings[15 ][1 6]. For example, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
          cells exhibit a rounded shape on softer matrices but spread extensively on stiffer ones 
          [1 7]. Such spreading enhances nutrient absorption, which supports cell proliferation 
          [17]. Studies on breast cancer cells cultured on agarose hydrogels of varying stiffness 
          revealed that cells in stiffer hydrogels had higher viability under doxorubicin (DOX) 
          treatment, suggesting that stiffer hydrogels may better mimic the increased stiffness 
          of tumor tissue, thus improving chemoresistance study outcomes[18 ][19 ]. With breast 
          cancer tissue stiffness typically over 4 kPa, stiffer hydrogel models may better 
          simulate the tumor microenvironment and increase predictive accuracy for in vivo 
          behavior [5].
        </p>
        <p>
          PhaseX, a tunable HA-based hydrogel, demonstrated the impact of stiffness in ex vivo 
          models. By adjusting HA to achieve 380 Pa stiffness, PhaseX maintained head and neck 
          squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) explants for up to 9 days, preserving both tissue area 
          and live cell count [18]. The hydrogel stiffness can also be adjusted by crosslinking 
          HA with methacrylate anhydride to form methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA/HAMA). 
          Lu et al. showed that by adjusting the concentration of MA and the crosslinking and 
          the ultraviolet light exposure, HAMA of different stiffness can be formed. Different 
          stiffness of HAMA also resulted in different viability [lu]. Tailoring hydrogel 
          stiffness to approximate the native tumor environment may have more physiologically 
          relevant models, potentially increasing the predictability of ex vivo results for in 
          vivo outcomes.

        <p>
          Interestingly, cancer cells migrating from spheroids can stiffen surrounding 
          collagen matrices through strain-induced stiffening, showing that cell migration and 
          hydrogel stiffness mutually influence one another in tumor modeling [20]. This 
          bidirectional relationship highlights the importance of optimizing hydrogel stiffness 
          to mimic real tumor conditions effectively.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.2.2.Porosity">
        <h4>2.2.2. Porosity</h4>
        <p>
          Even though higher stiffness tends to improve the viability of solid tumors, 
          cells were observed to migrate from the dense collagen matrix to the loose collagen 
          matrix, indicating that the cells showed a tendency toward a more compliant 3D matrix 
          of collagen [19]. However, Sapudom et al. suggest that cell migration may be influenced 
          by matrix porosity instead of stiffness, with cells migrating from small to larger 
          pores [21 ]. Most bulk hydrogels have dense polymer networks with nano-sized pores, 
          which are typically insufficient for nutrient diffusion, cell migration, and 
          proliferation [22 ]. The microarchitecture, consists of pore size and fiber diameter, 
          is shown to guide cellular behaviors such as myofibroblast differentiation 
          independently of matrix stiffness [20][23].
        </p>
        <p>
          Micropores can be formed by fabricating microspheres with gelatin. Gelatin is used as 
          it is highly water soluble. It is a good porogen as pores can be formed fast and 
          facilitate cell migration and proliferation. Lu et al. fabricated porous HAMA using 
          gelatin microspheres (GMS) template method. It was found that human umbilical vein 
          endothelial cells (HUVECs) migrated more significantly in macroporous HAMA than in 
          non-macroporous ones, which restricted cell movement and concentrated cells on the 
          hydrogel surface [23].
        </p>
        <p>
          Pore structure is also crucial for vascularization. Porous HAMA supports greater vessel density 
          and cell proliferation than its non-macroporous counterpart, with a pore diameter range of 
          200 to 250 µm being optimal for cell viability, migration, and vascularization compared 
          to smaller or larger pores. This range is suitable for tumor cells which has an average 
          diameter of 10 to 20 µm. This pore diameter can act as a guideline for designing hydrogel 
          models [24]. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="#2.2.3.Degradation">
        <h3>2.2.3. Degradation</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogel scaffold degradability is essential for providing temporary support that adapts 
          as new tissue forms. Scaffold degradation can occur through enzymatic hydrolysis, ester 
          hydrolysis, or photolytic cleavage of polymer chains, allowing the structure to break 
          down gradually [25 ]. Precise control of degradation is vital to ensure the scaffold 
          lasts long enough to support cells until the newly formed tissue can sustain itself. 
          This degradation mimics dynamic physical cues of the extracellular matrix (ECM), 
          influencing cell behavior critical for processes like spreading, migration, 
          proliferation, and differentiation [26].
        </p>
        <p>
          A common approach to tune hydrogel degradation is to incorporate matrix 
          metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive crosslinkers. For example, methacrylated 
          hyaluronic acid (MeHA) hydrogels with MMP-sensitive links allow human mesenchymal 
          stem cells (hMSCs) to reshape their environment by secreting enzymes to degrade the 
          matrix, which enhances cell spreading and differentiation. Studies show that hMSCs 
          in MMP-sensitive hydrogels express higher chondrogenic markers and reduced 
          hypertrophic markers, promoting cartilage formation while limiting calcification 
          [27 ]. Similarly, HA hydrogels conjugated with MMP-sensitive peptides better 
          preserved live cells and tissue morphology in patient-derived tumor slices (PDTS) 
          than non-degradable gels, highlighting the importance of MMP-degradability in maintaining 
          PDTS viability [18].
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, designing degradable hydrogels with controlled, 
          cell-responsive degradation supports tissue development by providing 
          crucial structural and biochemical cues.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="#2.2.4.Crosslinking">
        <h4>2.2.4. Crosslinking Density</h4>
        <p>
          Crosslinking density affects stiffness, porosity, and degradability in hydrogels. 
          Higher density increases stiffness and stability but reduces porosity, limiting 
          nutrient diffusion and cell migration. This dense network also slows degradation 
          [26]. Adjusting crosslinking balances these factors, enabling hydrogels to mimic 
          tissue properties effectively, especially for accurate tumor modeling.
