        <h3>2.1. Current PDTE Models</h3>
        <p>
          Tumor models must maintain tissue structure and stromal cell distribution for 
          effective evaluation of stromal-targeting therapies [5]. PDTE preserves native 
          architecture, cell-cell and cell-extracellular microenvironment (ECM) interactions, and immune composition, making them 
          essential for rapid drug testing in ex vivo studies [12].
        </p>

          subtitle="<b>Figure 2: Gelatin sponge-based culture [5].</b>"></image-component>
        <p>
          PDTE models using gelatin sponges support preclinical drug testing and TME 
          studies, but often experience tissue degradation and reduced viability within 
          six days. This challenge was partially addressed by advanced slicing technologies 
          like vibratomes to improve sample consistency [5].

      <div id="2.1.2.Matrigel">

          subtitle="<b>Figure 3: Matrigel culture.</b>"></image-component>
        <p>
          A mouse tumor extract rich in ECM components, Matrigel is widely 
          used for culturing embryonic and malignant cells, but it only supports 
          a short-term culture of 3 days due to declining viability 
          afterwards [17][18].

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/hagel.png"
          subtitle="<b>Figure 4: PhaseX - HA-based hydrogel culture.</b>"></image-component>
        <p>
          Developed by the Translational Tumor Engineering (TTE) lab, this HA-based 
          hydrogel provides enhanced support for PDTE compared to traditional PTFE 
          membranes and Matrigel. Its HA-based composition resembles native ECM, 
          enhances tissue preservation by providing tunable properties like stiffness, 
          degradability and adhesivity, thereby supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells [18][19]. 
          However, PhaseX cannot independently modulate HA concentration and stiffness, limiting its flexibility for varied applications [19].   
        </p>
        <sl-divider></sl-divider>
      <div id="2.2.Effects">
        <h3>2.2. Effects of Matrix Properties on PDTE</h3>

      <div id="2.2.1.Stiffness">
        <h4>2.2.1. Stiffness</h4>
        <p>
          Matrix stiffness affects the cell behavior, stability and scaffold integrity [20]. Generally, stiffer matrices 
          promote greater cell spreading, proliferation, and differentiation [21][22]. For example, 
          hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) changed from a rounded shape on softer matrices to more spread out on stiffer ones, 
          enhancing nutrient absorption, supporting cell proliferation [23]. Studies on breast cancer cells further 
          demonstrate that stiffer hydrogels increase cell viability, even under chemotherapy (doxorubicin treatment), suggesting that stiffer hydrogels may 
          better mimic the increased stiffness of tumor tissue, thus improving chemoresistance study outcomes [24][25].
        </p>
        <p>
          PhaseX hydrogel with tunable stiffness maintained both the tissue area and live cell count of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
          explants for up to 9 days [18]. Crosslinking HA with methacrylate anhydride (MA) can form methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA/HAMA), 
          enabling stiffness adjustment to simulate the TME stiffness and increase the 
          physiological relevance of ex vivo models, increasing the predictability of ex vivo results for in vivo outcomes [19]. 
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/hama.png"
          subtitle="<b>Figure 5: Different stiffness of HAMA fabricated [20].</b> "></image-component>

        <p>
          Interestingly, cancer cells migrating from spheroids can stiffen surrounding 
          collagen matrices through strain-induced stiffening, showing that cell migration and 
          hydrogel stiffness mutually influence one another in tumor modeling [26]. This bidirectional 
          relationship is essential for optimizing hydrogel stiffness to mimic real tumor conditions effectively. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="2.2.2.Porosity">
        <h4>2.2.2. Porosity </h4>
        <p>
          In most scaffolding materials, the porosity of the scaffolds plays an important role 
          in directing tissue formation and function[27]. Cells often migrate from dense to 
          loose matrices, seeking compliant environments [25][28]. Most bulk hydrogels have 
          dense nano-sized pores that limit nutrient diffusion, cell migration and proliferation [29]. 
          As such, increased porosity can have a beneficial effect on the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, 
          particularly in tissue culture models that lack a functional vascular system, thereby improving 
          cell viability and mimicking in vivo-like conditions [27].
        </p>
        <p>
          Micropores formed by gelatin microparticle (GMP) templating, as used by Lu et al., can facilitate 
          enhanced cell migration and vascularization. Gelatin is often used to form microspheres as it is a 
          good porogen with high water solubility, pores can be formed fast and facilitate cell migration and 
          proliferation. Lu et al. found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) migrated more 
          significantly in macroporous HAMA than in non-macroporous ones, which restricted cell movement and 
          concentrated cells on the hydrogel surface [19][30]. Porous HAMA with a pore diameter range of 
          200µm to 250µm also supported higher cell viability, migration and vascularization compared to 
          smaller or larger pores as they align better with the typical tumor cell diameter of 10µm to 20µm, 
          creating physiologically relevant tissue culture models for studying tumor behavior and drug responses [31].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.2.3.CellAd">
        <h4>2.2.3. Cell Adhesivity</h4>
        <p>
          The cell adhesivity is an important property since it also significantly affects cell behaviours 
          including spreading, proliferation, and differentiation [29]. The incorporation of RGD has been proposed as 
          RGD can mimic cell adhesion proteins and bind to cell-surface receptors, creating a hospitable microenvironment 
          for cells within the 3D polymeric network of the hydrogels [32]. A few studies tested the effects of RGD by 
          fabricating hydrogels with a wide range of RGD concentrations (0 to 2 mM). The results showed that under 
          standard culture conditions, compared to HA hydrogels without RGD, while there is no significant difference in 
          cell morphology and viability even though adhesion is known to influence viability, RGD significantly increased 
          cell spreading [33][34]. Since a variety of cells have been shown to bind to the RGD-modified hydrogel scaffolds 
          favourably, it is indeed necessary to investigate the effects of incorporating RGD in our MeHA hydrogel model 
          as part of the optimisation process [35].
