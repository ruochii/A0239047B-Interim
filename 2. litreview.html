      <div id="2.1.CurrentModels">
        <h3>2.1. Current PDTE Models</h3>
        <p>
          Tumor models must maintain tissue structure and stromal cell distribution for 
          effective evaluation of stromal-targeting therapies [5]. PDTE preserves native 
          architecture, cell-cell and cell-extracellular microenvironment (ECM) interactions, and immune composition, making them 
          essential for rapid drug testing in ex vivo studies [12].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.1.1.GelatinSponge">
        <h4>2.1.1. Gelatin Sponge-based Cultures</h4>
        
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/gelatinsponge.png"
          subtitle="Figure 2: Gelatin sponge-based culture [5]. "></image-component>
        <p>
          PDE models using gelatin sponges support preclinical drug testing and TME 
          studies, but often experience tissue degradation and reduced viability within 
          six days. This challenge was partially addressed by advanced slicing technologies 
          like vibratomes to improve sample consistency [5].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.1.2.Matrigel">
        <h4>2.1.2. Matrigel </h4>
        
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/matrigel.png"
          subtitle="Figure 3: Matrigel culture. "></image-component>
        <p>
          A mouse tumor extract rich in ECM components, Matrigel is widely 
          used for culturing embryonic and malignant cells, but it only supports 
          a short-term culture of 3 days due to declining viability 
          afterwards [13][14].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.1.3.HA">
        <h4>2.1.3. HA-based Scaffold</h4>
        
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/hagel.png"
          subtitle="Figure 4: PhaseX - HA-based hydrogel culture. "></image-component>
        <p>
          Developed by the Translational Tumor Engineering (TTE) lab, this HA-based 
          hydrogel provides enhanced support for PDTE compared to traditional PTFE 
          membranes and Matrigel. Its HA-based composition resembles native ECM, 
          enhances tissue preservation by providing tunable properties like stiffness, 
          degradability and adhesivity, thereby supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells [14][15]. 
          However, PhaseX cannot independently modulate HA concentration and stiffness, limiting its flexibility for varied applications [14].   
        </p>
        <sl-divider></sl-divider>
      <div id="2.2.Effects">
        <h3>2.2. Effects of Matrix Properties on PDTE</h3>
        <p>
          To establish an effective hydrogel-based model, it is crucial to understand how 
          specific matrix properties influence the structural and functional stability. 
          Key biophysical factors include architecture (e.g., dimensionality, topography, 
          porosity) and mechanics (e.g., stiffness, elasticity), which have been shown 
          to influence cancer cell behavior, particularly in proliferation and migration [16]. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/biophy.png"
          subtitle="Figure 5: Biophysical properties and features of an engineered microenvironment [16]. "></image-component>

      <div id="2.2.1.Stiffness">
        <h4>2.2.1. Stiffness and Cancer Cell Viability</h4>
        <p>
          Matrix stiffness affects the cell behavior, stability and scaffold integrity [17]. Generally, stiffer matrices 
          promote greater cell spreading, proliferation, and differentiation[18][19]. For example, 
          hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) changed from a rounded shape on softer matrices to more spread out on stiffer ones, 
          enhancing nutrient absorption, which supports cell proliferation [20]. Studies on breast cancer cells further 
          demonstrate that stiffer hydrogels increase cell viability, even under chemotherapy (doxorubicin treatment), suggesting that stiffer hydrogels may 
          better mimic the increased stiffness of tumor tissue, thus improving chemoresistance study outcomes [21][22].
        </p>
        <p>
          PhaseX hydrogel with tunable stiffness maintained both the tissue area and live cell count of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
          explants for up to 9 days [14]. Crosslinking HA with methacrylate anhydride (MA) can form methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA/HAMA), 
          enabling stiffness adjustment to simulate the TME stiffness and increase the 
          physiological relevance of ex vivo models, increasing the predictability of ex vivo results for in vivo outcomes [15]. 
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/hama.png"
          subtitle="Figure 6: Different stiffness of HAMA fabricated and the resultant cell viability during the culture period [15]. "></image-component>

        <p>
          Interestingly, cancer cells migrating from spheroids can stiffen surrounding 
          collagen matrices through strain-induced stiffening, showing that cell migration and 
          hydrogel stiffness mutually influence one another in tumor modeling [23]. This 
          bidirectional relationship is essential for optimizing hydrogel stiffness 
          to mimic real tumor conditions effectively.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.2.2.Porosity">
        <h4>2.2.2. Porosity and Nutrient Diffusion</h4>
        <p>
          Even though higher stiffness supports the viability of solid tumors, porosity 
          enhances nutrient diffusion and cell migration [23]. Cells often migrate from dense to loose matrices, 
          seeking compliant environments [22][24]. Most bulk hydrogels have dense nano-sized pores that limit nutrient 
          diffusion, cell migration and proliferation [25].
        </p>
        <p>
          Micropores formed by gelatin microspheres (GMS) templating, as used 
          by Lu et al., can facilitate enhanced cell migration and vascularization. Gelatin is often used 
          to form microspheres as it is a good porogen with high water solubility, pores can be formed 
          fast and facilitate cell migration and proliferation. Lu et al. found that human umbilical vein 
          endothelial cells (HUVECs) migrated more significantly in macroporous HAMA than in 
          non-macroporous ones, which restricted cell movement and concentrated cells on the hydrogel surface [15][26].
          Porous HAMA with a pore diameter range of 200µm to 250µm also supported higher cell viability, migration, and 
          vascularization compared to smaller or larger pores as they align better with the typical tumor cell 
          diameter of 10µm to 20µm [27].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="2.2.3.Degradation">
        <h4>2.2.3. Degradability and Scaffold Adaptability</h4>
        <p>
          Hydrogel scaffold degradability enables dynamic adaptation to cellular remodeling needs,
          mimicking ECM's natural turnover [28][29]. Incorporating metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive 
          crosslinkers with MeHA hydrogels allow human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to reshape their 
          environment by secreting enzymes to degrade the matrix, promoting cell spreading and differentiation. 
          Studies show MMP-sensitive hydrogels better preserve tissue integrity and cell viability in PDTE 
          compared to non-degradable hydrogels [14][30]. Thus, designing degradable hydrogels with controlled, 
          cell-responsive degradation supports tissue development by providing crucial structural and biochemical cues.
        </p>
