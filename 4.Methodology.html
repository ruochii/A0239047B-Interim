        <p>
          Tumors were collected from the National Cancer Center Singapore (NCCS). 
          Samples were processed within two to five hours after resection. 
          Before processing, tumor tissues were washed three times with 
          sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer. Then, 
          prepared at a thickness of 300 µm using a precision-cut 
          vibrating-blade microtome (Leica VT1200S). Following the 
          slicing process, the slices were placed in a complete 
          culture medium (1X DMEM/F12 media enriched with 
          10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 
          0.1mg/ml Primocin, and 1X ROCK pathway inhibitor) and 
          incubated under standard conditions (37 °C, 90% humidity, 
          13.5% CO2) for one hour to recover. After this recovery phase, the slices 
          were randomly distributed to MeHA gels.

          <p>
            0.5g of HA was dissolved in 50 mL of mixed solvent of 
            Dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O (1:2 v/v), stirred at 
            700 rpm overnight in the 4 ℃ fridge. MA was added 
            dropwise into the solution, adjusting the pH to 8.5 
            using 4 M NaOH. The reaction continued around 24 
            hours in the 4 ℃ fridge with stirring. Throughout the 
            reaction, the pH was maintained at 8.5 with a 
            second pH adjustment after the first 10 hours. 
            Subsequently, MeHA was dialyzed for 5 days in a dialysis 
            membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 3.5 kDa after 
            centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 minutes) to remove precipitates. 
            Finally, the MeHA was freeze-dried for 3 days and stored at 
            4 ℃ for future use.

          The solution's pH was then adjusted to  9  using 4M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 
          MA was added drop by drop, ensuring the pH remained at 9 for the duration of the 
          reaction, followed by a 5-day dialysis process using a Thermo Scientific 
          SnakeSkin™ 3.5K MWCO, 16 mm I.D. Dialysis Tubing [31]. The MeHA was then

        <p>
          We synthesized MeHA hydrogels with 10 distinct stiffness levels by 
          modulating the concentration of LAP in the hydrogel solution. 
          The stiffness of these hydrogels is directly proportional to LAP concentration, 
          ranging from 97Pa to 2.4kPa (Figure 16).

        <h4> 4.2.2. Pore Structure Generation </h4>
        <p>
          GMS were fabricated as shown in Figure 13. Fine particles were expected 
          after the washing and drying stage, but aggregation persisted even after vigorous 
          shaking during washing. To address this, clumps due to aggregation were cut into smaller pieces 
          with scissors. This led to irregular particles forming and caused the formation 
          of irregular pore shapes. This deviated from our goal of creating a uniform 
          pore structure that would serve as a more ideal physical microenvironment for controlled proliferation.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/aggsem.png"
        subtitle="Figure 17: Irregular particle shapes and pore shapes observed under SEM. "></image-component>

        <p>
          It was found that more clumps were formed when oil was fully removed from the residue during the filtration 
          step. Therefore, we attempted to collect the residue when the residue was still moist and less clumps observed.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/refinedgms.png"
        subtitle="Figure 18: Less aggregation of GMS observed with the refined method. "></image-component>
  
        <p>
          Using the refined filtration step, we successfully created three distinct GMS size range with round 
          particles, resulting in hydrogels with uniform pore diameters in three categories: 
          less than 100μm, 100μm to 200μm, and 200μm to 300μm. This uniformity in pore size will enhance the 
          consistency of the microenvironment within the hydrogel, supporting more controlled cellular 
          interactions and nutrient diffusion. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/sem.png"
        subtitle="Figure 19: Three distinct GMS size range with three distinct pore size range. "></image-component>
        
        <p>
          Since the average size of a tumor cell is 10 to 20 microns, we also aim to fabricate pores smaller than 10μm to investigate cell behavior and interactions 
          within a confined space [27]. To achieve this, we will first assess the smallest GMS size range we can obtain from the less than 100μm batch 
          using smaller sieves. If the resulting GMS size range is not below 10μm, we will fabricate gelatin nanospheres by adjusting the parameters in 
          our existing protocol.
