          Tumors were collected from the National Cancer Center Singapore (NCCS). 
          Samples were processed within two to five hours after resection. 
          Before processing, tumor tissues were washed three times with 
          sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer. Then, 
          prepared at a thickness of 300 µm using a precision-cut 
          vibrating-blade microtome (Leica VT1200S). Following the 
          slicing process, the slices were placed in a complete 
          culture medium (1X DMEM/F12 media enriched with 
          10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 
          0.1mg/ml Primocin, and 1X ROCK pathway inhibitor) and 
          incubated under standard conditions (37 °C, 90% humidity, 
          13.5% CO2) for one hour to recover. After this recovery phase, the slices 
          were randomly distributed to MeHA gels.

            0.5g of HA was dissolved in 50 mL of mixed solvent of 
            Dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O (1:2 v/v), stirred at 
            700 rpm overnight in the 4 ℃ fridge. MA was added 
            dropwise into the solution, adjusting the pH to 8.5 
            using 4 M NaOH. The reaction continued around 24 
            hours in the 4 ℃ fridge with stirring. Throughout the 
            reaction, the pH was maintained at 8.5 with a 
            second pH adjustment after the first 10 hours. 
            Subsequently, MeHA was dialyzed for 5 days in a dialysis 
            membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 3.5 kDa after 
            centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 minutes) to remove precipitates. 
            Finally, the MeHA was freeze-dried for 3 days and stored at 
            4 ℃ for future use.

            GMP were generally fabricated by the water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion method. 
            The gelatin solution was first achieved by dissolving 3 g of gelatin 
            powder from porcine skin in 30 mL of preheated H2O (over 40 ℃), then dropwise 
            added into 40 mL of soybean oil with stirring at 800 rpm for 5 minutes. 
            The water-in-oil emulsion was cooled to 10 ℃ with continuous stirring. 
            GMP were collected by vacuum filtration with 2 µm filter paper. 
            The collected GMP were washed with acetone, followed by drying in 
            60 ℃ oven overnight. The achieved GMP were sieved with a set of 
            standard sieves(400 µm, 315µm, 250 µm, 150 µm) and divided the 
            particles into desired sizes.

              GMP60 were fabricated by the double oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) emulsion method. 
              1 g of gelatin powder from porcine skin was dissolved in 30 mL of preheated H2O 
              (over 40 ℃). 10 mL of ethyl acetate was added into the gelatin solution and 
              stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was added dropwise into 
              60 mL of soybean oil, stirring at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. 
              Then, the emulsion was added into precooled -20 ℃ ethanol in a 2000ml beaker 
              with continuous stirring. . GMP were collected by vacuum filtration with 2 µm 
              filter paper. The collected GMP were washed with acetone, followed by drying

          The sieved GMP were added into the individual wells (diameter×height: 6 mm× 2 mm) 
          in PDMS mold and packed by slight taping. 20 µL of 90% ethanol was added into

          1.5% w/v MeHA and 0.05% w/v LAP were first dissolved in water (PBS was used for tissue culture instead) 
          to achieve the precursor solution. The GMP plates were immersed in the precursor solution under vacuum 
          for 10 minutes for solution perfusion. Subsequently, the MeHA solution-filled plates were transferred 
          into the well in PDMS mold (diameter×height: 8 mm× 3 mm), more precursor solution was added to ensure 
          the well was fully filled. For tissue culture, the tumor slice was embedded. The resultant mixture was 
          crosslinked under ultraviolet light (405 nm, 30 mW/cm2) for 120s. After crosslinking, hydrogels were 
          immersed in water at room temperature and shook overnight to dissolve the gelatin particles. For stiffness 
          characterization, the porous gels were sent for rheology. For pore size characterization, the porous gels 
          were freeze-dried and sent to SEM scanning for pore size characterization.

          were prepared. The mass of GMP plates used were obtained prior to the experiment. The hydrogels were 
          soaked in 1 mL of PBS and placed on a shaker left in the incubator (37 °C, 90% humidity, 13.5% CO2) 
          to mimic the actual culture condition. At every hour, 50 µL of supernatant was extracted and added 
          to 450 µL of PBS, 50 µL of PBS was added back to the well to maintain the concentration. 100 µL 
          of the diluted supernatant was added into the 96-well plate with 100 µL BCA solution. After the 
          9th hour, the 96-well plate was incubated for 1 hour and the contents were analysed with 
          Tecan spectrophotometer plate reader.
