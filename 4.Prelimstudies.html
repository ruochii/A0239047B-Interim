          500mg of HA was dissolved in 50ml of Dimethylformamide (DMF): water mixture with a 1:2 
          volume/volume ratio. The mixture was stirred continuously overnight at 4°C. 
          The solution's pH was then adjusted to  9  using 4M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 
          MA was added drop by drop, ensuring the pH remained at 9 for the duration of the 
          reaction, followed by a 5-day dialysis process using a Thermo Scientific 
          SnakeSkin™ 3.5K MWCO, 16 mm I.D. Dialysis Tubing [31]. The MeHA was then 
          freeze-dried and stored at 4°C until needed.

          GMS were fabricated by emulsion. 30mL of a 10% gelatin solution was incorporated dropwise into 60mL 
          of soybean oil with continuous stirring for 5 minutes. The water-oil emulsion mixture was transferred 
          into a 4°C fridge to cool the mixture to 10°C with continuous stirring. The mixture was filtered with 2µm 
          filter paper and thoroughly washed with acetone, followed by oven drying in 40°C oven overnight.  
          The fabricated GMS were filtered with a set of standard sieves  (mesh size: 150µm, 250µm, 315µm and 400µm) 
          and divided into groups.

          Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with 6mm diameter with 2mm height wells were filled with 
          GMS of desired size and increased packing with slight taping. GMS was soaked with 40μL of 
          90% ethanol and annealed in 40°C oven to allow the particles to adhere to each other and 
          form a well-packed porogen template.

          To prepare the precursor solution, 1.5%MeHA and 0.5% photoinitiator 
          LAP were dissolved in water. Subsequently, the GMS template was immersed 
          in the solution under vacuum. The resultant mixture was then exposed to ultraviolet light (405 m, 30 mW cm−2) for 2 
          minutes to induce crosslinking.

        <p>
          We synthesized MeHA hydrogels with 10 distinct stiffness levels by 
          modulating the concentration of LAP in the hydrogel solution. 
          The stiffness of these hydrogels is directly proportional to LAP concentration, 
          ranging from 97Pa to 2.4kPa (Figure 16).

        <h4> 4.2.2. Pore Structure Generation </h4>
        <p>
          GMS were fabricated as shown in Figure 13. Fine particles were expected 
          after the washing and drying stage, but aggregation persisted even after vigorous 
          shaking during washing. To address this, clumps due to aggregation were cut into smaller pieces 
          with scissors. This led to irregular particles forming and caused the formation 
          of irregular pore shapes. This deviated from our goal of creating a uniform 
          pore structure that would serve as a more ideal physical microenvironment for controlled proliferation.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/aggsem.png"
        subtitle="Figure 17: Irregular particle shapes and pore shapes observed under SEM. "></image-component>

        <p>
          It was found that more clumps were formed when oil was fully removed from the residue during the filtration 
          step. Therefore, we attempted to collect the residue when the residue was still moist and less clumps observed.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/refinedgms.png"
        subtitle="Figure 18: Less aggregation of GMS observed with the refined method. "></image-component>
  
        <p>
          Using the refined filtration step, we successfully created three distinct GMS size range with round 
          particles, resulting in hydrogels with uniform pore diameters in three categories: 
          less than 100μm, 100μm to 200μm, and 200μm to 300μm. This uniformity in pore size will enhance the 
          consistency of the microenvironment within the hydrogel, supporting more controlled cellular 
          interactions and nutrient diffusion. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/sem.png"
        subtitle="Figure 19: Three distinct GMS size range with three distinct pore size range. "></image-component>
        
        <p>
          Since the average size of a tumor cell is 10 to 20 microns, we also aim to fabricate pores smaller than 10μm to investigate cell behavior and interactions 
          within a confined space [27]. To achieve this, we will first assess the smallest GMS size range we can obtain from the less than 100μm batch 
          using smaller sieves. If the resulting GMS size range is not below 10μm, we will fabricate gelatin nanospheres by adjusting the parameters in 
          our existing protocol.
